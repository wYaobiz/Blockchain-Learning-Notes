# L3.2 Smart Contracts and Solidity 
## Smart Contracts 
An Ethereum smart contract is self-executing computer programs used to facilitate a transaction between various parties (e.g. a buyer and a seller) and can be verified by all participating nodes in the Ethereum network.


## Solidity Review 
This page list common Solidity syntax. It's geared for a quick review as your working through the development of your smart contracts. For more depth, please review Solidity developer documentation: https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.4.24/

### Solidity versioning
Solidity source files can contain any number of contract definitions. Each Solidity file also includes a thing called "Version Pragma". It is used to prevent the code from being compiled with future compiler versions that might introduce incompatible changes. Most of the time, the definition looks like this:

```
pragma solidity ^0.4.20;
```

In the example above 0.4.20 is the desired compiler version.

### Contracts
Now, let's put it into code.

Contracts in Solidity are similar to classes in object-oriented languages. They contain data in variables and functions that can modify these variables.

They are defined by using a contract keyword, followed by the contract name and two brackets { } which will later enclose contract variables and functions. For example:


```
pragma solidity ^0.4.20;

contract ParentObject {



}
```

### Variables
Wow! You've successfully created the frame of your contract! Now, it's time to start learning about how your contract will work. We'll start by finding out what type of variables there are.

**Variable types**
State variables are used to store information on the blockchain. They can also be manipulated by the functions within the contract.

Solidity is a statically typed programming language, meaning that each variable must have its type specified. Examples of the main data types:

**Booleans**
Can only have one of the two following values: true or false. The keyword for booleans is bool.

**Integers**
Integers can be split into main groups: regular integers (can store both positive and negative values) and unsigned integers (can only store values that are 0 or higher)

Regular integer has keywords from int8 to int256. The number signifies the maximum number of bits it can store (thus limiting the maximum value), and it can be any number between 8 and 256 as long as it incremented in steps of 8 (e.g., int16 is valid but int17is not). The int keyword alone would be understood as int256.

Unsigned integers follow the same logic. The only difference is the keyword which ranges from uint8 to uint256. Keyword uintcan also be used instead of uint256.

**Addresses**
The address keyword is used to hold Ethereum addresses. If you're planning to store an Ethereum address, you will need to use the address keyword.

**Strings**
The string variable is used to store text information. If you need to store a variable that should contain text information use the string keyword.

**Variable definition**
There are more data types, but we will go into more details in further lessons.

Variables and their values are defined like this.

contract Pizza {

```
bool isWarm = true;

uint slicesLeft = 3;
```
}


```
pragma solidity ^0.4.20;

contract ParentObject {

    // Write your solution below

    uint maxChildrenPerParentObject = 10;

    uint minChildrenPerParentObject = 1;

}
```

### Arithmetics
Now that you learned to define the variables for your contract, it's time to go through some basic math commands that will be useful later for defining your planet's code.

**Arithmetic operations**
Integers can be used for arithmetic operations:

Addition x + y
Subtraction x - y
Multiplication x * y
Division x / y
Remainder x % y
Exponentiation x ** y (x to the power of y)
For example:

uint x = 16;

uint pizza = 4;

uint result = 0;

result = x + pizza; // 16 + 4 = 20

result = x - pizza; // 16 - 4 = 12

result = x * pizza; // 16 * 4 = 64

result = x / pizza; // 16 / 4 = 4

result = x % pizza; // 16 % 4 = 0

result = x ** pizza; // 16 ^ 4 = 65536

A real world example:

uint pizzaSlices = 6;

uint people = 2;

uint slicesPerPerson = pizzaSlices / people;

### Structs
As we've learned the basics for defining varibles, now we will learn to create the structure that defines your variables properties: name, type, coordinates (X and Y), and so forth.

**Structs**
A struct is a special data type that allows the programmer to group a list of variables.

Structures are defined like this:

```
struct Car {

string make;

string model;

uint16 year;

uint16 horsepower;
}
```

### Mappings
Now that you've defined your variables, we'll learn how to create a variable that will later map your variable to the blockchain - a special list where all other variables are stored.

Mappings allow the programmer to create key-value pairs and store them as a list. Concepts like this also are known as hash tables.

Mappings are defined like this:

mapping(key_type => key_value) mappingName;

key_type should be replaced by a data type. Two commonly used variable types for mapping keys that we already know about are address and uint. It is important to note that not every data type can be used as a key. For instance, structs and other mappings cannot be used as keys.

Similarly, key_value should be replaced by the value type. Unlike with keys, Solidity does not limit the data type for values. It can be anything, including structs and other mappings.

A real-world example of a mapping:

mapping(address => uint256) balance;

This mapping could hold the bank account balance in uint256 for the given address.


## Identity & Smart Contracts 
**Identity (on Ethereum)**
Your Ethereum public address, or wallet. 
This means that when a smart contract allocates resources to user, just given that user tokens or other assets, they’re doing so by using that user’s public Ethereum address, which is also called the wallet. 
![](L3.2%20Smart%20Contracts%20and%20Solidity/BC11E3DC-1F0E-4BF3-A604-DA7E072DF2FA.png)

The user’s blockchain identity is their wallet. In short, Ethereum public address allows you to have an identity on the Ethereum network. It allows for smart contracts and other users to allocate resources or assets to your wallet.

## Deploying Smart Contract Review 
### Install Truffle and Ganache CLI
Ensure that you have installed npm with version 5.0+ on your system.

```
npm -v
```
Run the following command:

```
sudo npm install -g ganache-cli truffle
```
This is a global installation, so no need to worry about the installed location.

### Run Ganache CLI
After installation, you can start to develop your own smart contracts.

First, you need to create a simulated environment for running smart contracts on your local computer:

```
ganache-cli
```
Note: Ganache CLI runs within your system memory, so everything will be back to fresh if restart occurs. If you desire to utilize the same wallet for testing upon restarts, take note of Ganache CLI output regarding 'Mnemonic' wallet words under the HD Wallet section. Stop Ganache and modify your Ganache command line statement to include --mnemonic "string of words".

Example:

```
ganache-cli --mnemonic 'trick core barely fold sample icon display hollow smoke task emotion pepper'
```
To discover additional options, investigate additional command line arguments utilizing --help.

```
ganache-cli --help
```

### Compile smart contracts
```
truffle compile
```
This compiles the original code into Ethereum bytecode. If everything goes well, it will create .json file under build/contracts folder.

### Deploy smart contract
Make sure to configure your network settings. Modify truffle.js file (or truffle-config.js for windows), example below:

```
module.exports = {
  // See <http://truffleframework.com/docs/advanced/configuration>
  // to customize your Truffle configuration!
  networks: {
    development: {
      host: "localhost",
      port: 8545,
      network_id: "*" // Match any network id
    }
  }
};
```

Run the following command to start the migrations scripts and deploy your smart contracts:

```
truffle migrate
```
