# L3 Verify Message Signature
## Sign and verify a Message 
### Why sign and verify messages?
Signing a transaction help prove ownership of these transactions and prove that transaction and blockchain identity were not tampered with. It allows us to trust the validity of data saved on a blockchain and the validity of users interacting with it.
A digital signature ensures:
	- **Authentication** - A valid digital signature proves to the recipient of the message that the message was sent by a known sender. 
	- **Integrity** - The recipient and sender can prove the message was not altered in transaction. 
	- **Non-repudiation** - The message sender cannot deny sending the message. 

### How does signing and verification work?
3 steps to sign and verify a message. 
	1. Generate a private key and wallet address
	2. Sign a message using the wallet address
	3. Verify the message using the address and the signature

### Step 2: Sign a message 
To sign a message, the private key and message are passed through a signing algorithm which produces a unique digital signature. If anything in the process, the private key, wallet address, signature, message/transaction algorithms, were altered in the process, a different digital signature would be produced making it apparent something went wrong.
**Signing the message produces a unique digital signature.**

**An example, in Javascript**
```javascript
// Setup libraries
const bitcoin = require('bitcoinjs-lib')
const bitcoinMessage = require('bitcoinjs-message')
...

// Given the message and private key, sign a Bitcoin message
var signature = bitcoinMessage.sign(message, privateKey, keyPair.compressed)

// Print out the signature
console.log(signature.toString('base64'))
// => 'G9L5yLFjti0QTHhPyFrZCT1V/MMnBtXKmoiKDZ78NDBjERki6ZTQZdSMCtkgoNmp17By9ItJr8o7ChX0XxY91nk='
```


### Step 3: Verify a Message 
There are existing Verification Algorithms that will take in a Wallet Address, the Signature, and a Transaction, and verify whether or not the given Wallet Address was used to sign the given Transaction (or Message).

**An example, in Javascript**
```javascript
// Setup libraries
const bitcoin = require('bitcoinjs-lib')
const bitcoinMessage = require('bitcoinjs-message')


// Verify a Bitcoin message
const address = '1HZwkjkeaoZfTSaJxDw6aKkxp45agDiEzN'

const signature = 'HJLQlDWLyb1Ef8bQKEISzFbDAKctIlaqOpGbrk3YVtRsjmC61lpE5ErkPRUFtDKtx98vHFGUWlFhsh3DiW6N0rE'

const message = 'This is an example of a signed message.'

console.log(bitcoinMessage.verify(message,address,signature));
```
